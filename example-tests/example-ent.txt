of this 218232 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 218232 samples is 10670.66, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 121.4964 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.227207742 (error 2.73 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.095710 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
