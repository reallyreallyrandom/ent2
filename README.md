# ent2
A randomness testing suite for Makers. 

Creation of a new accurate and easy to use randomness test suite tailored for TRNG Makers generating in the sub 1 MB space. It will be a derivative of the `ent` test suite @ https://www.fourmilab.ch/random/ incorporating PASS and FAIL statuses for individual tests, alleviating the need for interpretation of p values. The results of the tests will be followed by a final conclusive recommendation as to whether the sample set can be used for cryptographic purposes.
